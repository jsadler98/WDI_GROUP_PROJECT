# WDI30 Project 3: HappyCabby

## Introduction

This was the group project section of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembley London, to create this app me and my colleagues used HTML, JWT, Bluebird, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Express-jwt, Mongoose, Mocha & Chai, AngularJS, Bulma, SCSS. We also used Google maps and Eventful as 3rd party API's.

## The Idea

After brain storming and drawing up ideas with my colleagues we came up with the idea to create an app to help taxi drivers make more money and spend less time on the road. we achieved this using the 3rd party API's as Eventful plotted all the events on the Google map meaning that the cabby's would have an idea of where the more busier areas where in London meaning they could make more money and spend less time on the roads wasting petrol and time.

## What was a success?

Working so effectively in a team of three and creating such a great app was a great success, during this time I learnt a lot about my team skills and realised that I am confident whilst working in a team and I can communicate with my other colleagues whilst still completing my own tasks. I learn't a lot off my colleagues during this project whether that be styling or how to integrate a 3rd party API. Also in comparison to other projects I feel like my styling has really improved as I had two other brains giving me feedback so I learnt a lot and got some good honest opinion on some styling choices.

Example code:

I worked on a rating system for the app, it allowed the cabby's to rate the destinations they had picked customers up from. To do this I used an Angular library called ng-RateIt which would create the star ratings in the comments.

```
  <div class="control">
          <ng-rate-it resetable="false" ng-model="vm.comment.rating"></ng-rate-it>
        </div>
        
```

## Challenges

During this project the one thing I found challenging was understanding what work that my other colleagues had completed and understanding their code and keeping up to date with all the changes that where being pushed through GitHub whilst still trying to complete my own work, as mentioned in other readMe's I need to work on time management but I'm sure that will come with experience. Code wise I would get a lot of errors because of sloppy incorrect syntax and that is something I would love to work on.

## Conclusion 

I really enjoyed working on this group project as I had two great teammates that I learn a lot from and at the end of it all we created a beautiful looking app with a real purpose.
